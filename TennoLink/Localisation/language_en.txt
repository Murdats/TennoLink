During the airing of her (now legendary) \"Plea for the Forgotten\" Ava's tear-duct implants malfunctioned. Stunned audiences mistook this as an emotional display and the donations poured in. Ava won hearts and minds for the Grineer Empire.\r\n\r\nNow, under her direct supervision, the charity program produces the majority of Grineer combat munitions. \"Ava's Children\" live shortened lives in orbital labor camps.\r\n\r\n\"Children are our future.\"","/Lotus/Language/Bios/TestBioB":"TARGET: Sargus Ruk\r\n\r\nSargas Ruk claims to be a self-made man. He rose from humble beginnings as a Grineer Freighter hand to the rank of Fleet Minister. Ruk's appointment was a surprise to those that knew him. He had little education, a 'denied' reproduction rating, and one of the lowest intellect scores seen in ambulatory Grineer. Yet, Ruk has an uncanny ability to influence those around him - incredible given his speech is nearly incomprehensible (he has an enormous tongue deformity).\r\n\r\nPerhaps Ruk's inexplicable rise to power has its origins in his humbler days. He worked Orokin recovery missions for the fleet. Ruk's detractors insist he has Orokin technology that weakens will. To date, 100% of these accusations have been withdrawn.\r\n\r\n(No quote available)","/Lotus/Language/Challenges/Challenge_TreasureHunter_Name":"Treasure
